This the backend of the bus ticketing system
hey there lets get into fascinating world of software developement..
Here's a comprehensive plan for building a bus booking and ticketing system using the MERN stack:

## Project Architecture

**Frontend:** React.js with modern hooks and state management
**Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework
**Database:** MongoDB for flexible document storage
**Authentication:** JWT tokens with refresh token mechanism

## Database Schema Design

**Users Collection:**

- Personal details (name, email, phone, address)
- Authentication credentials (hashed password)
- Booking history references
- User roles (customer, admin, operator)

**Buses Collection:**

- Bus details (number, type, capacity, amenities)
- Operator information
- Seat layout configuration
- Maintenance status

**Bookings Collection:**

- User and schedule references
- Seat numbers and passenger details
- Payment information and status
- Booking status (confirmed, cancelled, completed)
- Timestamps for tracking

## Core Features Implementation

**User Authentication System:**

- Registration with email verification
- Secure login with password hashing
- Role-based access control

**Admin Dashboard:**

- Bus and route management
- Schedule creation and modification
- Booking analytics and reports
- User management system

## Technical Implementation Strategy

**State Management:**

- Context API for global state (user authentication, cart)
- Local state for component-specific data
- Custom hooks for API calls and data fetching

**API Design:**

- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Input validation using Joi or similar
- Error handling middleware

**Database Optimization:**

- Indexing on frequently queried fields
- Aggregation pipelines for analytics
- Connection pooling for performance

**Security Measures:**

- Input sanitization and validation
- CORS configuration
- Secure cookie handling
